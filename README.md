# tud-themes

This package provides stylesheets for Jupyter Notebooks inspired by the corporate design of TU Dresden.

You can install the themes using pip:

```
pip install tud-themes
``` 

You can then start a Jupyter server themed using the default TUD theme using the command:

```
tud-themes-notebook
```

If you want to pick a different theme, simply add the name (e.g. for the dark theme):

```
tud-themes-notebook dark
```

Not all themes are implemented yet. Note that you may have to refresh your browser cache
(``Ctrl+F5`` in Chrome and Firefox) when switching between themes for the changes to be 
rendered.

Advanced functionality is currently undocumented.
