# tud-themes

This package provides stylesheets for Jupyter Notebooks inspired by the corporate design of TU Dresden.

You can install the themes using pip:

```
pip install tud-themes
``` 

You can then start a Jupyter server themed using the default TUD theme using the command:

```
tud-themes-notebook
```

Advanced functionality is currently undocumented.
